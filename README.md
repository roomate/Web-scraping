# Mini-Project: Web-scraping

Web-scraping is a classical topics in data-mining, it consists in fetching data from the web via a simple HTTP request.

In this case, the objective is to extract and store .XML files contained in the tar.gz archives at this [URL](https://echanges.dila.gouv.fr/OPENDATA/CASS/).
Once the archives are downloaded, you have yet to extract them and recover their .XML documents. This mini-project is a great deal to learn more on [**TarFile** Objects](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/tarfile.html) and [HTML parsing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html)!
